## Introduction

Project 2 focuses on working with time series from ECG datasets for classification of the status of the patient. We analyzed the publicaly available [PTB Diagnostic ECG Database](https://physionet.org/content/ptbdb/1.0.0/) and [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database](https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mitdb/) It consists of three parts: 
1. The first part consists in producing many different models for the classification of the PTB dataset.These include classic models (logistic regression, Random Forests, Support Vector Machine) and more recent Deep Learning architectures (CNN, LSTM and Tranformer encoder)
2. The second part deals with creating good embeddings by exploring different techniques of representaion and tranfer learning.
3. The third part involves summarizing findings, answering general questions about the methods used, and exploring pros and cons of all the model implemented. 

## Features

In our implementation of the contrastive learning InfoNCE was adapted form [here](https://github.com/jefflai108/Contrastive-Predictive-Coding-PyTorch.git))

## Installation

A `requirement.txt` file is provided containing all the packages we used for this project. In order to install them you can simply run. To ensure they are all installed in your current environment please run

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Once you have all the needed packages in your environment as described above, you can simply open the notebook corresponding to the section you are interested in and run the code smoothly.
